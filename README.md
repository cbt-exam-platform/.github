# CBT Exam Web Application

## Overview
The CBT Exam Web Application is a modern, scalable web-based system designed to conduct computer-based tests for students and provide administrators with tools to manage exams, questions, and results.
The system follows a React + API Gateway + Backend Services architecture to support scalability, performance, and security.

## System Architecture
The application is built using a client–server model with separated frontend and backend services.
